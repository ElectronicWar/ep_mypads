MyPads
============
**This github repo will host the MyPads plugin for etherpad** *(if founded!)*.

Almost everyone is using or has already used Etherpad, the famous and free/libre online editor featuring real-time collaborative editing. But there is a missing feature in the new version which is highly desired by the community: a personal account for creating and managing groups and private pads.
This campaign, initiated and supported by Framasoft, aims to fund the development of a plugin to fulfill these requirements.

Note 1: You can make a donation of one of the predefined amounts. You can also enter any amount you wish, either with or without reward, by pushing the big blue "Contribute" button on the top right.
Note 2: This campaign is also available in French.

Etherpad is a highly successful collaborative and real-time online text editor. It is free/libre, which means everyone can use it, improve it and install it on their own server. This is what Framasoft did in 2011 with the Framapad project.

The original version of Etherpad offered the very useful "private groups" feature, which allowed administrators and managers of pads created within a group. But this version of Etherpad was limited, unstable and resource-consuming. Etherpad developers have since done a lot of work to completely rewrite the application and produce a much lighter, more functional, and more usable version. But it was too complicated to implement private groups in this new version right away. This was postponed to a later date. At the moment, we are still stuck at this point. Unless we decide to implement this feature as a plugin in the new version, along with additional improvements.

This is the very purpose of this funding campaign, which also wishes to emphasize that free does not mean free of charge and that one can develop free/libre software with crowdfunding.
